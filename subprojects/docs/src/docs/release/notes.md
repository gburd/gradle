<!--
### Example new and noteworthy

Think of every feature section as a mini blog post.

1) Make sure the release notes render properly: `./gradlew :docs:releaseNotes && open subprojects/docs/build/docs/release-notes.html`
  TIP: Continuous build is useful when working on release notes.
  NOTE: The markdown processor does not know GitHub flavored markdown syntax.

2) Explain why users should care.
  TIP: Avoid technical details with no indications how this impacts users.

3) Link to documentation or a blog post for more detailed information.

4) Show, don't just tell, if possible.
  NOTE: Totally fine to just link to an example that show the feature.

### Deprecation warning improvements

In this release, deprecation warnings are no longer displayed in build by default. Instead, all deprecation warnings in a build would be collected and a single warning would be rendered at the end of build:

    There're X deprecation warnings, which may break the build in Gradle 5.0. Please run with --warnings=all to see them.

As said by this warning, you can run the build with command line option `--warnings=all` or property `org.gradle.warnings=all` to have all warnings displayed as before.
Of course, you could use command line option `--warnings=no` or property `org.gradle.warnings=no` to suppress all warnings, including the one displayed at the end of build.

### Provider API documentation

In this release, the Gradle team added a new chapter in the user guide documenting the [Provider API](userguide/lazy_configuration.html).

### Faster C/C++ compilation and builds

#### Build Cache Support

We introduced [experimental C/C++ caching support](https://docs.gradle.org/4.3/release-notes.html#experimental-task-output-caching-for-c/c++-compilation) in Gradle 4.3, but this feature was hidden behind an additional flag until we had fixed some underlying correctness issues.

In this release, we have fixed some underlying issues with calculating the correct build cache key for C++ compilation and have removed the special flag.  If you [enable the build cache](userguide/build_cache.html#sec:build_cache_enable), Gradle will try to reuse task outputs from C/C++ compile tasks when all inputs (compiler flags, source, dependencies) are identical, which can [greatly reduce](https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-gradle-build-cache) build times.

Please note that there are [some caveats](userguide/build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching_known_issues_caveats) when using the build cache.  In particular for C++, object files that contain absolute paths (e.g., object files with debug information) are reusable and cacheable, but may cause problems when debugging.

#### Incremental Compilation

Gradle's incremental C/C++ compilation works by analysing and understanding the dependencies between source files and the header files that they include. Gradle can use this information to compile only those source files that are affected by a change in a header file. In some cases, Gradle could not analyze all of these dependencies and would assume all source files depend on all header files. Changes to any header file would require recompiling all source files, regardless of whether the compiler output would change or not. This also affected how well the Gradle build cache could be used to skip compilation.

In this release, Gradle's incremental C/C++ compilation is now able to understand most dependencies between source files and header files. This means incremental compilation will occur more often and builds are more likely to see cache hits.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

<!--
### Example deprecation

### Deprecation of no-search-upward command line options 

The command line options for searching in parent directories for a `settings.gradle` file (`-u`/`--no-search-upward`) has been deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 5.0. A Gradle project should always define a `settings.gradle` file to avoid the performance overhead of walking parent directories.

## Potential breaking changes

* Two overloaded `ValidateTaskProperties.setOutputFile()` methods were removed. They are replaced with auto-generated setters when the task is accessed from a build script.

* The `maven-publish` plugin now produces more complete `maven-metadata.xml` files, including maintaining a list of `<snapshotVersion>` elements. Some older versions of Maven may not be able to consume this metadata.

### HTTP build cache does not follow redirects

When connecting to an HTTP build cache backend via [HttpBuildCache](dsl/org.gradle.caching.http.HttpBuildCache.html), Gradle does not follow redirects any more, and treats them as errors instead.
Getting a redirect from the build cache backend is mostly a configuration error (e.g. using an http url instead of https), and has negative effects on performance.
